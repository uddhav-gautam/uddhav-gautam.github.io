                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p><b>Uddhav Gautam (he/him),</b> a native of Kathmandu, Nepal, is an LL.B. graduate from the University of Trento, Italy. He specializes in Comparative, European, and International Law. Uddhav aspires to become a mixed-method researcher, envisioning a pivotal role for quantitative approaches in Nepalese policymaking, particularly in human rights, culture, and diversity management.</p>
                    <p>Since 2021, Uddhav has been an active member of <b>Manavsewa Ashram</b>, one of Nepal's largest NGOs dedicated to combating homelessness. His role at the <b>Ashram</b> has evolved from volunteer to key contributor, conducting in-depth policy research, preparing and editing reports with actionable recommendations, evaluating policy impacts, and advocating for evidence-based approaches through outreach and media.</p>
                    <p>Uddhav also works as a <b>Visiting Editor</b> for the <b>Trento Student Law Review</b>, a student-led comparative law journal of <i>Trento Law School</i>. Thus, he comprehends the difference and effective implementation of substantive and formal editing and has contributed to the editorial processes of numerous volumes of the TSLR. Additionally, he has co-authored and edited reports for <b>Jean Monnet Project for Academic Freedom</b>, co-funded by the EU, at University of Trento, aligning his goals with a deeper understanding of the factors that shape, influence, and are essential for fostering holistic academic discourse.</p>
                    <p>In addition, Uddhav has authored, co-authored, and published several articles within his field of interest. His current research investigates the question <b>'What does it mean to afford culture?'</b> from a post-structuralist perspective. He aims to examine the migration patterns of popular cultural production and explore how societies invest in specific popular culture themes while discarding others. Besides, Uddhav indulges his passion for writing stories and poetry. His writings have appeared in various forums, and he is currently putting together his first collection of Nepali poems titled <b>'Uddhav: Human Version'</b> and simultaneously working towards a short collection of stories titled <b>'स्पेगेटीका त्यान्द्राहरु' (Strands of Spaghetti).</b></p>
                    <p>Uddhav thrives on engaging with diverse perspectives and is proficient in <b>Nepali, English, Hindi, and Italian</b>. He believes connecting with people worldwide enriches his understanding of the pluralistic world and its diversity. A dedicated traveller and music enthusiast, Uddhav finds liberation in melodies. An avid reader, he is constantly in pursuit of knowledge across disciplines.</p>
